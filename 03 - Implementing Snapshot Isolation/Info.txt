Snapshot Isolation

- The SQL Server Database Engine mantains versions of each row that is modified
- The chance that a read operation will block other transactions is greatly reduced
- SQL Server uses a copy-on-write mechanism when a row is modified or deleted
- tempdb is used to hold the version store
